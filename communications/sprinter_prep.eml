Dear Sprinter,


Thank you for signing up for the PyCascade Sprints! I hope you learn
something, build something, and have fun! There are a ton of exciting and
high impact projects to work on, and highly skilled project leads with
well-curated issues to help ensure you get the most out of the day. You
don't have to do anything to prepare for the Sprints, but here are a few
tips that may help you get the most out of the day:



   - Bring a laptop with you. We do not have loaners at the event, and
   while you could contribute and learn by direct pairing, a dedicated
   computer provides the best experience.
      - Extra Points: Remember to charge it tonight & bring the charger
      with you tomorrow.
   - Take some time to look over the projects on the sprints website
   <https://2020.pycascades.com/sprints/.>.
      - Extra Points: Decide on a few that you would find interesting to
      work on, and take the time go as far through the project's development
      guide as you can.
      - Note that you don't have to work on one of these projects! Doing so
      helps ensures you can sprint with other people, but it is
entirely okay to
      work on other projects as desired!
   - Look for opportunities to stay connected to the project after the
   sprints are over.


I hope you find these tips helpful! I look forward to sprinting on projects
with you tomorrow from 9:30 AM-5 PM at Revolution Hall.


Thanks!
