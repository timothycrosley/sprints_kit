# Tips for project leads

Steps you can take before the project day:

- Contributing guide that documents the intended flow and rules behind new contributions.
- Development environment instructions that document how to get a presumed new computer to the point where it can run the code locally, including the full test suite.
	+ **Extra Points**: Customize the instructions for the 3 most common Operating environments (Windows/Mac/Linux). This will pay dividends as the [odds are](https://insights.stackoverflow.com/survey/2019#technology-_-developers-primary-operating-systems) that a developer will be using a different OS then you do.
- Often times the contributing guide and the development guide are in one document. This is okay! As long as information is clearly portrayed to your users.
- A growth guide. Clearly lay out how contributors can "level-up" within your project. What does it take to become a core contributor? A co-maintainer?
- An online chat, such as gitter or slack, where contributors can ask questions.
- Ensure there are issues marked with the label "good first issue" or the equivalent in your issue tracker.
	+ **Extra Points**: Multiple kinds of issues help to ensure contributions can be productive independent of their background, skill level, or skill type.
                        Some example categories that can be good to include, and label, are:
		* Documentation
		* Small bugs
		* Small features
		* DevOps and testing infrastructure
		* Graphic design
- Avoid any urge you may be have to fix all the low-haning fruit and "clean-up" your repository for new contributors. This clean up is generally create the best kind of tasks for new contributors!
