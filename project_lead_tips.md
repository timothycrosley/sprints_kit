# Tips for project leads

Steps you can take before the project day:

- Contributing guide that documents the intended flow and rules behind new contributions.
- Development environment instructions that document how to get a presumed new computer to the point where it can run the code locally, including the full test suite.
	+ **Extra Points**: Customize the instructions for the 3 most common Operating environments (Windows/Mac/Linux). This will pay dividends as the [odds are](https://insights.stackoverflow.com/survey/2019#technology-_-developers-primary-operating-systems) that a developer will be using a different OS then you do.
- A growth guide. Clearly lay out how contributors can "level-up" within your project. What does ti take to become a core contributor? A co-maintainer?
- An online chat, such as gitter or slack, where contributors can ask questions.
- Ensure there are issues marked with the label "good first issue" or the equivalent in your issue tracker.
	+ **Extra Points**: Multiple kinds of issues are help to ensure contributions can come independent of the contributors background, skill level, or skill type.
		* Documentation
		* Small bugs
		* DevOps and testing infrastructure
- Avoid any urge you may be have to fix all the low-haning fruit and "clean-up" your repository for new contributors. This clean up is generally the best kind of tasks for new contributors!
